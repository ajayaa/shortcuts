Nova compute sends a call to neutron to create port.
Neutron creates port(Allocates mac address and IP)
Notifies DHCP agent 
Then neutron notifies L2 agent in nova compute



iproute2 is a set of tools to communicate between kernel space and user space using the netlink protocol.
========================================================
ifconfig --> ip addr and ip link
route --> ip route
arp --> ip neigh
iptunnel --> ip tunnel
ipmaddr --> ip maddr
netstat --> ss


If you need an additional IP address just for the moment you can add it to any interface on your machine with

 sudo ip address add <ip-address>/<netmask> dev <interface>
for instance

 sudo ip address add 172.16.100.17/24 dev eth0
would add 172.16.100.17 using a 24bit netmask to the list of addresses configured for your eth0.




In the backend:
open vswitch
you physical network
vendor switches


Nova network:

only flat + flat dhcp + vlan based network
vlan has 4096 limit on number of hosts

Neutron Architecture:
=====================

nova networking refresher: Bring deprecated. Multi-host mode in nova-network. No migration story of nova-n to neutron.

multi-host mode:
================
different layer 3 do go to nova-n. Can be a choke point. In multi host mode nova networking is installed on every compute node. All the compute need external ip addressed to do the natting. 

Distributed virtual router in juno neutron.

Set of defined apis in neutron. Define a network. Depending on the plugin the apis are matched to implementation.

Core plugin and service plugin. Core plugin does basic L3 networking. Service plugin provides special functions.

L3 router is a service plugin.

ML2 plugin:
Does database access. 
Type manager: manages id of vxlan, gre
Mechanism manager: ovs, cisco, arista etc.

modular plugin vs monolithic plugin:
Earlier ovs-plugin and linux bridge plugin were monolithic. Now ml2 plugin uses those.
L3 agent is a choke point if you use ovs and linux bridges.
