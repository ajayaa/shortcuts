It's better to list out the files to index first and then use
-L option with ctags.

e.g:

find . -name "*.py" > list
ctags -L list

:ts gives you list of tags.
:tn to next tag.
:tp to previous tag
:tf to first tag
:tl to last tag
:tag function_name will take you to tag's definition.
opposite of <C-]> is <C-t>
